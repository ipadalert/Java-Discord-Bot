# Java-Discord-Bot
Simple discord bot using JDA. Command management is not mine, used to introduce myself to the JDA wrapper. First major project I started, here for archive purposes. 

Used for discord management and just general commands
```
Includes:
    Guild specific prefix's using SQL, with a set prefix command
    User commands:
        Avatar
        Ban and Kick
        Mass DM
        Help
        User info
        Private messaging
        Nitro code generator
        Print screen, screenshot generator
        Message purge
        Role remover and adder
        Iterative messaging, with splitting words and iterating a single message
```
The management system for commands is from duncte123 and his BotCommons lib, along with the prefix related code
